# Docker Analytics Sandbox

A comprehensive, containerized development environment for data analysts and data engineers, providing enterprise-grade tools at minimal cost. This project enables rapid development and testing of data pipelines, analytics workflows, and SaaS prototypes using industry-standard technologies.

## ðŸŽ“ Free for Education
This project is completely free for:
- University Students
- College Students
- Educational Institutions
- Self-Learners
- Anyone without access to paid subscription services

We believe in making enterprise-grade development tools accessible to everyone, especially students and learners who may not have access to expensive commercial solutions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YavinOwens/Docker_Analytics_Sandbox.git
   cd Docker_Analytics_Sandbox
   ```

2. Start the environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Container Health Checks
- View container status: `docker ps`
- Check container logs: `docker logs <container-name>`
- Monitor resource usage: Docker Desktop Dashboard

### Database Connectivity
- Verify Oracle container health: `docker logs SQL_PY_Sandbox-oracle`
- Test connection: `sqlplus system/oracle@//localhost:1521/FREE`
- Check listener status inside container: `lsnrctl status`

### Storage Issues
- Verify MinIO accessibility: `curl http://localhost:9000`
- Check MinIO logs: `docker logs SQL_PY_Sandbox-minio`
- Monitor disk usage: `docker system df`

### IDE and Development
- Clear VS Code Server cache if needed
- Verify extension installations
- Check Ollama connectivity for AI features
